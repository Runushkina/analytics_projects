# Project description
### Customer: 
Product manager

### Tasks:
- Conduct exploratory data analysis;
- Analyze the trade assortment;
- Select the main and additional categories of goods;
- Formulate and test statistical hypotheses.

### Data Description:
The customer provided a dataset with transactions for an online store of goods for home and life "So far, everything is still here."

**Data structure:**
- order date;
- buyer identifier;
- order identifier;
- Name of product;
- quantity of goods in the order;
- item price (per piece).

# Project progress and results:
Using data parsing, I formed product categories. For each category, he described its characteristics: the number of goods, seasonality, price range and share of total revenue. Then, together with the customer, we determined the criterion for classifying categories as the main ones - the average revenue per product. According to this criterion, I suggested which categories can be attributed to the main ones. To confirm my assumption, I conducted a statistical hypothesis test. The test confirmed the assumption.

I provided the result for the product range manager in the form of a presentation and a dashboard.
